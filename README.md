# The React Quiz App

The "React Quiz" project is an exciting web application developed using cutting-edge technologies like React, Vite, and the use of useReducer and dispatch for state management. Its goal is to provide users with an interactive learning experience about React, one of the most popular frameworks for building modern user interfaces.

### Key Features:

- 15 React Questions: The project features a carefully curated selection of 15 questions related to React. Each question challenges users' knowledge of key React concepts, from components and props to state management and routing.

- Attractive User Interface: The application offers an attractive and user-friendly interface that allows users to effortlessly navigate through the questions, providing a seamless quiz experience.

- Utilization of useReducer and dispatch: The project demonstrates the effective use of useReducer and dispatch in React to manage the application's state. Each user response and progress is dynamically controlled through these mechanisms, enabling a dynamic and responsive user experience.

- Fictional API with JSON Server: To simulate a real API, the project employs JSON Server. This allows users to access a fictional data source that stores the quiz questions and their correct answers.

- Scores and Results: Upon completing the quiz, users can view their scores and an emoji reflecting their performance. Additionally, the highest score achieved is displayed, fostering friendly competition among participants.

- Restart and Play Again: Users have the option to restart the quiz at any time to retest their knowledge and improve their results.
